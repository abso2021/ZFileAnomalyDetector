# ZFileAnomalyDetector
This is an automated monitoring tool designed to periodically scan a selected folder for .z data files, convert them to .csv format, validate their contents, and send alert emails if anomalies are found. Upon startup, it prompts the user to input one or more recipient email addresses and choose a source folder. It then creates a subfolder for converted files and, every hour, processes all .z files by extracting relevant data, formatting it as CSV, and checking specific columns for threshold violations. If any file contains abnormal values, it logs the file and sends a single summary email to the specified recipients, ensuring efficient and centralized error reporting.
